  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Categories Matter</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">"Miscellaneous" is the enemy of a good budget. When you throw everything into one bucket, you lose visibility.</p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Common Categories</h3>
  <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Housing</strong>: Rent/Mortgage, utilities, insurance.</li>
    <li><strong>Transportation</strong>: Car payment, gas, public transit.</li>
    <li><strong>Food</strong>: Groceries vs. Eating Out (keep these separate!).</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>By tracking these separately, you might realize you're spending more on coffee than on your electricity bill!</p>
